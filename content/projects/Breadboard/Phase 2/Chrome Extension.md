## Chrome Summariser Extension

A Chrome extension for using Breadboard with the Google Chrome API. Currently, the extension has a single purpose: to summarise web page content and select text. This version of the extension is exploratory. When feasible, a more generalised version will be created to be used with any board.

Two basic chrome extensions that were built initially while exploring the available options for creating one. In this example, there are two extensions that are built with Vite/React/Typescript and Typescript/Webpack respectively. As a future direction for this branch, we would like to create a template repository for this and have commands such as "create-breadboard-chrome-extension -ts/webpack" or "create-breadboard-chrome-extension -react/vite" that would generate a template for a basic chrome extension using the specified tools and containing a basic breadboard, thus speeding up the initial process of getting started with chrome extensions and breadboard.

An initial chrome extension built with Vite, React and Typescript that runs a basic breadboard. Users can type a message into the extension's popup window and have the message logged back to them as they type it.

The most up-to-date and stable version of this project, that uses the Claude API and Breadboard to summarise either all the text in the current chrome tab or a selected piece of text. The summariser can be run both from the extension's main popup window and from the context menu after selecting a bit of text from a page, right-clicking and selecting the "Breadboard > Get summary" option in the context menu. Compared to the initial branches that were the starting point for this project, the summariser follows a different structure in terms of organising files which seemed like a better choice for a chrome extension built with Vite and React.

This follows the same structure as the summariser, but the focus here was to integrate a board that performs sentiment analysis on a selected piece of text.
