## Demonstration of Sentiment Analysis Board

In this demonstration, we will showcase one of the boards we've been developing, which is designed for text classification, specifically sentiment analysis.

### Overview

The primary goal of this board is to perform sentiment analysis on given text inputs using the Hugging Face interface API.

### Inputs and Configuration

1. **API Key**: This key is required to access the interface API.
2. **Text Input**: A piece of text that we want to analyse for sentiment.
3. **Use Cache**: This option speeds up requests by using cached responses if the API has encountered the same input before.
4. **Wait for Model**: This flag indicates whether we should wait for the model to fully load before receiving a response.

### Example

Let's consider the input: "I really like the work that I saw at the conference."

By performing sentiment analysis on this text, we expect a positive result. 

### Results

Upon analysing the input, the API returns scores for specific labels. In this case, the "positive" label received a very high confidence level, indicating that the text was perceived as highly positive.

### Next Steps

In a subsequent video, we will demonstrate a use case of this board using our Chrome Breadboard extension.
