## Text Classification Board Demonstration

### Introduction
We would like to demonstrate one of the boards we have been working on. The purpose of this board is to perform text classification using the Hugging Face API.

### Inputs Overview
Here are the key inputs for the board:

- **API Key**: Required to access the API.
- **Input Text**: The piece of text we want to classify. For example: "I recently bought a device from your company, but it is not working as advertised. I would like to get reimbursed."
- **Candidate Labels**: The set of categories we want to classify the text against.
- **Multi-label Flag**: Indicates if the labels can overlap.
- **Use Cache Flag**: Speeds up requests by returning a cached response if the model has seen the inputs before.
- **Wait for Model Flag**: Ensures the model fully loads before returning a response, useful for large language models.

### Example Demonstration
Given the input text, "I recently bought a device from your company, but it is not working as advertised. I would like to get reimbursed," we expect the label to be "refund" as this is the core subject of the text.

### Running the Classification
When we send the input to the API, the response confirms that "refund" is the highest-scoring label.

### Conclusion
This simple example illustrates the functionality of our text classification board. In a later video, we will demonstrate a use case of this board using our Chrome Red Board extension.
