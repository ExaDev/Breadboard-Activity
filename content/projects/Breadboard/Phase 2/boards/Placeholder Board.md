1. **Concept:**
	- Serve as an interface for the [universal filter](projects/Breadboard/Phase%202/boards/Universal%20Filter%20Board.md) board.
	- Act as a template to facilitate implementation.
2. **Implementation Steps:**
	- Design the placeholder board structure.
	- Define interface parameters: `inputs`, `outputs`, `mappings`.
	- Allow passing a concrete board as an implementation to this placeholder.
3. **Functionality:**
	- Interface-like behaviour:
		- Acts as a middle layer between input data and the concrete board.
	- Accepts mappings of inputs and outputs to connect with the concrete implementation board.
	- In theory in a board that uses the placeholder board, could then have the placeholder board replaced with a concrete board that implements the same interface.
4. **Design Considerations:**
	- Flexibility:
		- Ensure it can accommodate various implementations.
	- Scalability:
		- Design for incremental data processing and feedback integration.
5. **Next Steps:**
	- Create a basic prototype of the placeholder board.
	- Define the mapping schema for inputs and outputs.
	- Test with a sample concrete board to ensure compatibility and functionality.
