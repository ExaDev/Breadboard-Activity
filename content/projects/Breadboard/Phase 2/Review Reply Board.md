## Demo Board

This demo board is a wrapper board to pass a sample review to the `business-review-replier` board.

- A random review is selected from an array of reviews and passed to the `coalesce` node.
- The input `review` is also passed to the `coalesce` node. The value is permitted to be empty.
- The `coalesce` node then picks the first non-empty value from the input task and the review.
