## Chrome Extension for Performing Text Labelling

#### Overview

This is another variant of the Chrome Extension for summarising web pages or selected text. This variant allows users to specify a set of labels that the selected text will be labeled against. For example, if the user gives the following list of labels as input: `"legal", "economy", "law"`, and select a piece of text on a webpage, the extension will run the text labeling board on it and display the scores that correspond to the probability of each label, in the same order that the labels were listed. More information about the parameters can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/detailed_parameters#zero-shot-classification-task).
