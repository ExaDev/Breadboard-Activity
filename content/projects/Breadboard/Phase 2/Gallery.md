## Gallery

- [github.com/ExaDev/breadboard-gallery](https://github.com/ExaDev/breadboard-gallery)

A proof of concept application built with NextJS and StaticCMS. The application can **both build and runtime** of fetching the contents of git repositories and using a Breadboard Graph to process the repository's contents. Currently, the application operates on the Breadboard repository and uses Claude to summarise `README.md` and `package.json` files.
